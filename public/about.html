<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>WELCOME! Hi, i'm Ephraim Newton, iam 23years old and i'm from Nigeria.</p>

<p>I happen to be a dancer, Hypeman and a content creator, and i just earned myself a B.Sc in Accounting (a big congrats to me). 
  So i finally made a decision to learn a skill, and after a lot of research on what skill is it i can learn, i fell in love 
  with Web development and i started making research on how to go about it, so luckily for me i came across Udemy and i found 
  the perfect course and tutor(Dr. Angela Yu) that can help me learn my preferred skill.  </p>

<p>I'm glad to say that i am an aspiring web developer with a B.Sc in Accounting.</p>
